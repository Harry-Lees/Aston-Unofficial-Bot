    We've just introduced a new verification bot to ensure that all users are members of Aston University.

    - If you're currently a 2nd-year student or have had a foundation year, please contact a Moderator. You will be allowed in the Server, but we have to verify you manually!

    - If you are a *lecturer* or someone from another year group, please contact a Moderator to get manually verified.

    - You will be asked to provide your "aston.ac.uk" email address so we can properly verify that you go to Aston University.

    Thanks for joining the **Aston Unofficial Discord Server**

    Please verify your email by [clicking here](http://astonunofficial.co.uk/discord/register?user_id={})

    :warning: You will not be able to join the server without an aston.ac.uk email address :warning:

    You will be allocated a teacher or student role when you join the server.
    These will grant you access to all general channels that you are applicable for.
    After joining, there are several things you can do:

    :book:  **1. Read our info-rules channel**
    This channel contains all the rules and regulations for our server.

    :teacher:  **2. Join a Subject**
    This gives you access to your subject specific channels where you can find people from your course!
    To do this, please go into the #roles channel and react to the Emojis related to your subject.

    :soccer:  **3. Join Optional Channels**
    We have lots of optional channels for things such as Gaming, Music, Tech, and much more!
    To do this, please go into the #roles channel and react to the Emoji related to your interest.
